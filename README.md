# snnif

### Dependencies

- `docker` - Required to build and run the Docker containers.
  - This can be installed using Docker Desktop, view the instructions
    [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). This framework was
    tested with Docker 28.0.4.
- `python` - Required to run the framework.
  - This framework was tested with Python 3.12.3.

### Directories

- `protocols` - Contains the Dockerfiles for the protocols
- `src` - Contains the source code for snnif.

### Usage

To run the framework, use the following command:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

`source` is used here to activate the virtual environment automatically. Remove
it in case you want to use a different virtual environment.

This will setup a virtual environment and install the required Python packages.

### Included protocols

Currently, the following protocols are included by default in this framework:

- [FALCON](https://github.com/snwagh/falcon-public)
- [Meteor](https://github.com/Ye-D/Meteor)
- [SecureNN](https://github.com/snwagh/securenn-public)

Chameleon and [ABYÂ³](https://github.com/ladnir/aby3) will likely be added in the
future. It will also be possible to add custom protocols using configuration
files.

#### Configuring a protocol

In order to add a protocol to the framework, two files are required. Inside the
`protocols` directory, add a directory with the name of the protocol. Inside
this directory, add a `Dockerfile` and a `config.json` file.

The `Dockerfile` should contain the instructions to build the Docker image for
the protocol along with the necessary dependencies. **It is important to install
`nethogs`, `python3` and `python3-pip` in the container.** An example for the
_FALCON_ protocol:

```dockerfile
# Use Ubuntu 18.04 as the base image, if necessary, choose a different version
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# Install the necessary dependencies, make sure to include nethogs
RUN apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y \
  git \
  make \
  g++ \
  libssl-dev \
  nethogs \
  python3 \
  python3-pip \
  && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Clone the FALCON repository
RUN git clone https://github.com/snwagh/falcon-public.git Falcon

# Build the FALCON protocol
RUN cd Falcon \
  && make all -j$(nproc)

# Set the working directory to the FALCON directory
WORKDIR Falcon
```

By default, the framework assumes the `WORKDIR` is the root directory of the
container. It will look for the first line that specifies `WORKDIR`, and changes
this default value if one is found.

The `config.json` file should contain the configuration for the protocol. It
should be in JSON format and should contain the following fields:

- `run` - The command to run the protocol, this includes its arguments
  - In case it is necessary to run multiple instances of the protocol (e.g. one
    for each party), you can run each one in a sub-shell. See the configuration
    file for _Meteor_ for an example.
- `image` - The name of the Docker image to build

### Compatibility

This framework was written and tested on a machine using Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS with
Python 3.12.3. However, it should be possible to run it on any device with
Python 3 and Docker installed.
